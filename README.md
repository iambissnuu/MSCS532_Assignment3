# Assignment 3: Understanding Algorithm Efficiency and Scalability

## Description

This repository contains the implementation and analysis for Assignment 3. The goal of this assignment is to implement and compare the performance of Randomized Quicksort and Hashing with Chaining. A comparison with Deterministic Quicksort is also included.

## Files

- `randomized_quicksort.py`: Implementation of Randomized Quicksort.
- `deterministic_quicksort.py`: Implementation of Deterministic Quicksort (first element as pivot).
- `hashtable_chaining.py`: Implementation of a hash table using chaining.
- `test_cases.py`: Runs performance tests and demonstrates functionality.
- `analysis_report.pdf`: Report containing theoretical analysis, empirical comparison, results table, and conclusion.
- `README.md`: Instructions and summary.

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Open a terminal in the project folder.
3. Run:

```bash
python test_cases.py
